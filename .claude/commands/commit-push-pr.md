# Git Status
!`git status --short`

Based on git status above:

0. **If current branch is main** ask the user if they want to create a new branch, using the tool `AskUserQuestionTool` or create a new branch for the changes if not an interactive console.
1. **Stage and commit** changes with a descriptive message.
2. **Push** to the remote repository.
3. **Create PR** with:
   - Clear title summarising changes
   - Detailed description of what was done
   - Link to any related issues
   - Request review from appropriate team members

Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.).
